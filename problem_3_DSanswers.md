Part 1-Analysis

- The first network has many branches commits and people working on them whereas the other two are much less complex
-Yes there are different types of roles. There are users who might be looking at it to figure out who did what in the project, who did the most work, etc
	A list of potential user roles are:
		-project manager
		-contributor
		-project user
		-A person who wants to know more about the team's work
-A user might want to determine how much work is being done over the course of a longer period of time. Most large CS projects aren't finished in a day, 	so it would be interesting to see how productive a person is being over a period of time.
-I  want to design the visualization for the project manager. THe project manager has the needs of being able to keep track of work being done by the 		people he manages and determining how to divy up the workflow.
