I unfortunately wasn't able to implement all of part 4 because a lack of time. This pset is proabbly the most time consuming pset I've had thus far, and even though I started a week in advance, I wasn't able to finish. 

I did try to implement parts of what my part 4 should have. In addition to what is in my current version, I meant to implement the design that I came up with in the design studio:
      (a) All of the nodes would be scaled in relation the number of additions/deletions done that week by that user (I struggled in finding a way to sync the matching data from both commits data set and the stattistics data set.)  
      (b) When the user scrolls over the node, a pop up comes up which shares more detailed infromation such as commit message, As well as other information like message, date and the weeks. 
      (c) Centering of the graph, I tried many different ways to make the graph centered, but I couldn't find one (this same bug exist in my other part)
